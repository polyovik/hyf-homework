Ingredients
⅔ cup white sugar

⅓ cup all-purpose flour

¼ teaspoon salt

3 eggs, beaten

2 cups milk

2 tablespoons butter, softened

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

2 bananas, peeled and sliced

½ (12 ounce) package vanilla wafer cookies


Directions
Combine sugar, flour, and salt together in a medium saucepan. Add eggs and stir well. Stir in milk, and cook over low heat, stirring constantly.

When the mixture has thickened enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, remove from heat and continue to stir, cooling slightly. Stir in butter and vanilla until smooth.

Layer pudding with bananas and vanilla wafers in a serving dish. Chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.
